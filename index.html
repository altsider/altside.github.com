			<h2>What is Cube?</h2>
			<p>- Cube is an alternative format where players play the game using a relatively small pool of cards built by themselves. The format is usually accompanied by a few rule changes, such as effects ignoring Types and/or Attributes.</p>
			<p>- Our pool is composed of 512 cards: 500 randomly selected by a software, and 12 selected by the players. Players will also be able to replace 12 other cards during the process of selection.</p>
			<br>

			<h2>Type/Race Neutrality</h2>
			<p>- In this Cube, only Types are ignored. Cards whose effects are activated based on a certain Type of Monster, will now be able to work for every type. Note that this only applies to "races" such as Warrior, Dragon, Beast, Insect, etc., not to types such as Monster, Spell and Traps.</p>
			<p>- For example:</p>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;* Reinforcement of the Army's original effect: <i>Add 1 Level 4 or lower Warrior Monster from your Deck to your hand.</i></p>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;* Reinforcement of the Army's effect, now, with Type Neutrality: <i>Add 1 Level 4 or lower Monster from your Deck to your hand.</i></p>
			<br>

			<h2>Attribute Rotation</h2>
			<p>- During the process of selecting 500 random cards to make the pool, the software will also randomly pick an array of Attributes (with the exception of DIVINE).</p>
			<p>- During battle: <b>Normal</b> Monsters will gain effects based on their Attribute and the Attribute of the monster they are <b>attacking</b> (the attacked monster doesn't need to be Normal).</p>
			<p>- Attributes interact in 2 ways:</p>
			<div class="attr_sup">
				<img class="about_attr" src="./imgs/WATER.png"></img><span class="superior_to">></span>
				<img class="about_attr" src="./imgs/DARK.png"></img><span class="superior_to">></span>
				<img class="about_attr" src="./imgs/LIGHT.png"></img><span class="superior_to">></span>
				<img class="about_attr" src="./imgs/EARTH.png"></img><span class="superior_to">></span>
				<img class="about_attr" src="./imgs/WIND.png"></img><span class="superior_to">></span>
				<img class="about_attr" src="./imgs/FIRE.png"></img><span class="superior_to">></span>
				<img class="about_attr" src="./imgs/WATER.png"></img>
			</div>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;* <b>Normal</b> Monsters, when battling against Inferior Attributes, double their ATK.</p>
			<div class="attr_opp">
				<img class="about_attr" src="./imgs/WATER.png"></img>
				<span class="opposite_to">x</span>
				<img class="about_attr" src="./imgs/EARTH.png"></img>&nbsp;&nbsp;
				<img class="about_attr" src="./imgs/DARK.png"></img>
				<span class="opposite_to">x</span>
				<img class="about_attr" src="./imgs/WIND.png"></img>&nbsp;&nbsp;
				<img class="about_attr" src="./imgs/LIGHT.png"></img>
				<span class="opposite_to">x</span>				
				<img class="about_attr" src="./imgs/FIRE.png"></img>
			</div>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;* <b>Normal</b> Monsters, when battling against Opposite Attributes, cannot be destroyed by battle and the player takes no damage during that battle.</p>
			<br>

			<h2>Pendulum Duality</h2>
			<p>- All Pendulum monsters will have their scales changed so they have two values, their original value and 13 minus that value. This can increase the viability of Pendulum monsters in non-Pendulum decks.</p>
			<p>- For example:</p>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;* Performapal Trump Witch, original scales: <i><span style="color:rgb(64,127,255)"><4</span>|<span style="color:red">4></span></i></p>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;* Performapal Trump Witch, new scales: <i><span style="color:rgb(64,127,255)"><4</span>|<span style="color:red">9></span></i></p>
			<br>

			<h2>How to install:</h2>
			<p>- <b>Currently still in development</b>, but, you can already install this mod by copying the following code:</p>
			<pre>
{
	"url": "https://github.com/altsider/dngcubeexpansion",
	"repo_name": "/dng/ alt cube cards",
	"repo_path": "./repositories/cube",
	"data_path": "",
	"script_path": "script",
	"should_update": true,
	"should_read": true
},
{
	"url": "https://github.com/altsider/dngcubebanlist",
	"repo_name": "/dng/ alt cube banlist",
	"repo_path": "./repositories/lflists",
	"lflist_path": ".",
	"should_update": true,
	"should_read": true
}
			</pre>
			<p>- And pasting it inside your <code>./config/configs.json</code> file, inside the "repos" section.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;* Make sure to check if the added code is separated by "," from the original code.</p>
			<p>- Open the game. Check the repositories tab on the menu and see if there's a new section there named "/dng/ alt cube". There will also be a new banlist named "CUBE Banlist" in the Decks section.</p>
			<p>- All cube cards have yellow borders and have "[CUBE]" at the end of their names. <b>These cards are separate entities from their original copies, so don't use them with original cards.</b></p>
