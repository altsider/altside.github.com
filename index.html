			<h2>What is Cube?</h2>
			<p>- Cube is an alternative format where players play the game using a relatively small pool of cards built by themselves. The format is usually acompanied by a few rule changes, such as effects ignoring Types and/or Attributes.</p>
			<p>- Our pool is composed of 512 cards: 500 randomly selected by a software, and 12 selected by the players. Players will also be able to replace 12 other cards during the process of selection.</p>
			<br>

			<h2>Type/Race Neutrality</h2>
			<p>- In this Cube, only Types are ignored. Cards whose effects are activated based on a certain Type of Monster, will now be able to work for every type. Note that this only applies to "races" such as Warrior, Dragon, Beast, Insect, etc., not to types such as Monster, Spell and Traps.</p>
			<p>- For example:</p>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;* Reinforcement of the Army's original effect: <i>Add 1 Level 4 or lower Warrior Monster from your Deck to your hand.</i></p>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;* Reinforcement of the Army's effect, now, with Type Neutrality: <i>Add 1 Level 4 or lower Monster from your Deck to your hand.</i></p>
			<br>

			<h2>Attribute Rotation</h2>
			<p>- During the process of selecting 500 random cards to make the pool, the software will also randomly pick an array of Attributes (with the exception of DIVINE).</p>
			<p>- During battle: <b>Normal</b> Monsters will gain effects based on their Attribute and the Attribute of the monster they are <b>attacking</b> (the attacked monster doesn't need to be Normal).</p>
			<p>- Attributes interact in 2 ways:</p>
			<div class="attr_sup">
				<img class="about_attr" src="./imgs/WIND.png"></img><span class="superior_to">></span>
				<img class="about_attr" src="./imgs/LIGHT.png"></img><span class="superior_to">></span>

				<img class="about_attr" src="./imgs/FIRE.png"></img><span class="superior_to">></span>
				<img class="about_attr" src="./imgs/WIND.png"></img>
			</div>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;* <b>Normal</b> Monsters, when battling against Inferior Attributes, double their ATK and cause pierce damage.</p>
			<div class="attr_opp">
				<img class="about_attr" src="./imgs/WIND.png"></img>
				<span class="opposite_to">x</span>

			</div>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;* <b>Normal</b> Monsters, when battling against Opposite Attributes, cannot be destroyed by battle and the player takes no damage during that battle.</p>
