			<p>[*4] | ATK/2000 DEF/0</p>
			<p>Archetype: Gunkan</p>
			<p><i>Finally got to visit that harbor specializing in Gunkan Suships that I've been curious about for a while! The premium "Shari" here is limited to 2000 Suships a year, and uses specially developed smooth aged rice, giving it extra boldness not found anywhere else. The classy atmosphere made my heart sing, too. The Gunkan Suship served had a perfect balance of vinegar, nigiri, shine, and shape, demonstrating exquisite artisanship. The owner told me, "We are introducing rich yet mellow scented EDO-FRONT red vinegar in the near future," which I'm really looking forward to. However, I was disappointed the surrounding seas were a little noisy... so, giving it 4 stars with hope for improvements in the future.<br>-------------------<br>[ATTRIBUTE EFFECT]<br>1. If this Monster battles againt a WIND Monster, during Damage Calculation, double this card's ATK.<br>2. This Monster cannot be destroyed by battle when battling against a LIGHT Monster, and the playerin control of it takes no damage during that battle.<br>Neither effects can be negated.<br><br></i></p>
